# my-mod-the-cube
This work is about changing values which are scale, color, and rotation of a cube by passing time. 
This unity duty exists At the end of the first pathway of Unity Junior Programmer. 
Before i published also this work with WebGL at unity play too, i converted it to webGL format.  
In addition, there is an extra scene and some color material in the work. 
You can use it for your own goals! Have Fun :)
